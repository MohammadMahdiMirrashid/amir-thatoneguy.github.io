I'm Mohammad Mahdi (I also go by the name Amir).

I spend most of my time doing research.

I've recently had the great opportunity to start working and collaborating on multiple research projects I'm passionate about. <br>

When not working, I take hours-long walks outside, talk about life with friends, listen to extreme metal ([Vildjharta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSrMw_VbanM&ab_channel=CenturyMediaRecords) is a favorite), listen to classical music (usually [Rachmaninoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY&ab_channel=Variatio24)), and sometimes play the piano (and fail at it).
